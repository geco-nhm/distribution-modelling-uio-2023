This lab uses data installed with the MIAmaxent R package. 
The data are in the directory returned by the following R command: system.file("extdata", package = "MIAmaxent")

The worked exercise can be opened in RStudio with the following command: vignette("a-modeling-example", package='MIAmaxent')
From there, highlighed code can be run with CTRL-ENTER.

Alternatively, the source Rmarkdown file for this vignette is in this directory: "a-modeling-example.Rmd". Editing this file can be a nice way make notes as you work through the exercise.
